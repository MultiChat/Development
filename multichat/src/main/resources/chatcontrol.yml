# These are custom regular expression rules to alter messages sent through the chat.
# The regular expression in "look_for", is replaced by the value in "replace_with".

# These can be used to filter inappropriate language from chat as well as many other things.
# Some examples are shown below...

regex_rules:
# Example rule to replace [bold] with the format code %l to make bold text
- look_for: '\[bold\]'
  replace_with: "&l"
  permission: "multichat.regexrules.bold" # You can choose to specify permissions in order for the regex rules to apply
# Example rule to replace [italic] with the format code %o to make italic text

# These are custom regular expression triggered actions.
# The regular expression in "look_for", triggers the command in "command"
# You can choose to cancel the players chat event by setting "cancel" to true
# Setting "spigot" to true will send the command to the local spigot server the
# player is currently on and execute it there instead of on bungeecord.

# These can be used to filter inappropriate language from chat as well as many other things.
# Some examples are shown below...

# You can use %PLAYER% to refer to the player sending the message

# Example rule to kick someone who says a specific phrase
